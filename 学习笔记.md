创建对象的几种方式以及各自的优缺点？

什么事原型对象？

调用构造函数发生了什么
1、创建了一个新对象

2、将构造函数的作用域赋给新对象（因此this就指向了新对象）

3、执行构造函数中的代码（为这个对象添加新属性）

4、返回新对象


### What is a constructor?

A constructor is any function which is used as a constructor. The language doesn’t make a distinction. A function can be written to be used as a constructor or to be called as a normal function, or to be used either way.

A constructor is used with the `new` keyword:

    var Vehicle = function Vehicle() {
      // ...
    }

    var vehicle = new Vehicle();

### What happens when a constructor is called?
When new Vehicle() is called, JavaScript does four things:

1、It creates a new object.

2、It sets the constructor property of the object to Vehicle.

3、It sets up the object to delegate to Vehicle.prototype.

4、It calls Vehicle() in the context of the new object.

The result of `new Vehicle()` is this new object.

1. It creates the new object.
This is nothing special, just a fresh, new object: {}.

2. It sets the constructor property of the object to Vehicle.
This means two things:

    vehicle.constructor == Vehicle  // true
    vehicle instanceof Vehicle      // true

This isn’t an ordinary property. It won’t show up if you enumerate the properties of the object. Also, you can try to set constructor, but you’ll just set a normal property on top of this special one. To wit:

    vehicle;                          // {}

    var FuzzyBear = function FuzzyBear() { };
    vehicle.constructor = FuzzyBear;

    vehicle;                          // { constructor: function FuzzyBear() }
    vehicle.constructor == FuzzyBear; // true
    vehicle instanceof FuzzyBear      // false
    vehicle instanceof Vehicle        // true

The underlying, built in constructor property is something you can’t set manually. It can only be set for you, as part of construction with the new keyword.

3. It sets up the object to delegate to Vehicle.prototype.
Now it gets interesting.

A function is just a special kind of object, and like any object a function can have properties. Functions automatically get a property called prototype, which is just an empty object. This object gets some special treatment.

When an object is constructed, it inherits all of the properties of its constructor’s prototype. I know, it’s a brainful. Here.

    Vehicle.prototype.wheelCount = 4;
    var vehicle = new Vehicle;
    vehicle.wheelCount;         // 4

The Vehicle instance picked up the wheelCount from Vehicle‘s prototype

Now this “inheritance” is more than simply copying properties to the new objects. The object is set up to delegate any properties which haven’t been explicitly set up to its constructor’s prototype. That means that we can change the prototype later, and still see the changes in the instance.

    Vehicle.prototype.wheelCount = 6;
    vehicle.wheelCount;         // 6

But if we like, we can always override it.

    vehicle.wheelCount = 8;
    vehicle.wheelCount          // 8
    (new Vehicle()).wheelCount  // 6;

We can do the same thing with methods. After all, a method is just a function assigned to a property. Check it.

    Vehicle.prototype.go = function go() { return "Vroom!" };
    vehicle.go();                              // "Vroom!"

4. It calls Vehicle() in the context of the new object.
Finally, the constructor function itself is called. Inside the function, this is set to the object we’re constructing. (Why? Because that’s what Java does.) So,

    var Vehicle = function Vehicle(color) {
      this.constructor;       // function Vehicle()
      this.color = color;
    }

    (new Vehicle("tan")).color;   // "tan"
